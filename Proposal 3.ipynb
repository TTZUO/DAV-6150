    "As one of the seven major arts, film has become an important art form and entertainment carrier, and even an indispensable part of our lives. At the same time, movies can also be regarded as a form of investment that is extremely dependent on capital and industrial standards. Therefore, analyzing movie data can help to seize the development trend of the movie industry. Commercially successful films can not only attract audiences, but also enable film companies to make huge profits. Good directors, experienced actors and many other factors are very important for making good movies. The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) is an online database of movie actors, movies, TV shows, TV stars and movie productions. IMDb's materials include a lot of information about the film, actors, length, content introduction, ratings, comments, etc."

    "Currently, IMDB ratings are most commonly used for movie ratings. However, well-known directors and actors can always bring the expected box office income, but can not guarantee a high imdb score. In this project, we will build a movie grading model based on a large amount of movie data. Based on the existing movie data, we will predict the IMDB score of the movie. The score of the movie can objectively reflect the quality of the movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the real world, the IMDB score of a high box office movie is not necessarily high, but the IMDB box office with a high rating must be very high. Therefore, building a movie rating prediction system is of great significance to the expected box office of the film, and more importantly, film production Merchants can estimate their box office based on the IMDB score, which has a great impact on their publicity."

    "Since the data comes from the kaggle website, we directly download the data, the data format is a csv file, use different data visualization methods for different data, and use a line chart to visualize each released movie data and box office data. The budget of a movie directly affects the quality of the movie, and the box office of the movie also affects the rating of the movie. The dependent variable is the rating of the movie. The relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable can be analyzed using a correlation matrix or a heat map. In addition, we can use a histogram , Box plot, scatter plot and bar chart and other graphics for visual analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we use the IMDB score as the response variable to predict each variable. For movie ratings, since the dependent variable is a continuous type and is a prediction model, we use KNN, random forest, and SVM to predict the score.The performance of the three models is used as the weight of the combined model, and the output of the three independent models is combined into a whole model using weighted combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the evaluation of the model, we mainly use the root mean square error (rmse) to evaluate the model, but when the dimensions are different, rmse is difficult to measure the effect of the model. At this time, other evaluation indicators are needed to evaluate the model. In this project, We also use the R^2 score, rmse refers to the square root of the difference between the predicted result and the true result, the smaller the rmse, the better the model. The R^2 score is also called the coefficient of determination. The denominator is understood as the degree of dispersion of the original data. The numerator is the error between the predicted data and the original data. The division between the two can eliminate the effect of the degree of dispersion of the original data. The stronger the interpretation ability of y, the better the model fits the data. Conversely, the closer to 0, the worse the model fit."
